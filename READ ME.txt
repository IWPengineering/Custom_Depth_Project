Current Design:

Arduino with Adafruit Datalogging Arduino Shield (SD formatted and inserted)
Uses pins 4, 01-13, A4, and A5 (Sheild)

Display (SPI mode)
Uses pins 13-CLK, 12-MISO, 11-MOSI, 9-D/C, 8-RST, and 2-CS (powered by arduino board 5v and GND)

The Depth Sensor
Uses pin 5(Arduino)-Transmition Equipment-pin 5(Sensor)



In order to program and test this project, you will need a couple tools:

Github and the Custom_Depth_Project repository
See https://github.com/ and follow the instructions for signing up.
Try https://github.com/IWPengineering/Custom_Depth_Project.git for the repository
You many need to request access to this repository

The Arduino Software (we are using 1.6.8)
See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and follow the instructions for downloading
The nesesary libraries can be found on Github in the Libraries folder.
To add each Library to the Arduino programer, go to Sketch>Import Libraries>Add .ZIP Library...



Instructions for use:
There are two programes that are used for the Arduino

ResetTimeAndDate.ino
(Documents\GitHub\Custom_Depth_Project\Code\ResetTimeAndDate\ResetTimeAndDate.ino)
This will reset the time and date on the Datalogging shield to the time the program was compiled/uploaded
REPROGRAM IMIDEATLY WITH PROPER CODE: DO NOT RESTART

UltrasonicRangeSensor_with_SPI_Code.ino
(Documents\GitHub\Custom_Depth_Project\Code\URS with SPI code\UltrasonicRangeSensor_with_SPI_Code\UltrasonicRangeSensor_with_SPI_Code.ino)
This is the code that will proform the normal operation
It will:
* Read and interpret the data from the range sensor
* Keep track of the time and date, even if power is lost
* Create and write the date, time, and water level in a text document
* Display the time, date, and water level on a display
